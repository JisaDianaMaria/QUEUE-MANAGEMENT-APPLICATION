# QUEUE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION 

Implemented with threads and synchronization mechanisms to minimize customer wait time in queues.

This project aims to create an efficient customer management application so that they do not spend too much time waiting in queues. Within the application, the user can configure various settings, such as the simulation duration, the number of customers, the number of queues, and the arrival and service intervals of customers. Through the application's graphical interface, the user can input this information, and the application will monitor the total time each customer spends in the queue, calculating the average wait time. The ultimate goal of this topic is to provide a solution for optimizing queue-based systems by reducing customer wait times.
